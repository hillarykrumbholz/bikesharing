### Project Objective
We want to know if a bike-sharing startup will be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. 
We will be using CitiBike data from New York City as our baseline to determine the feasibility, and to make an informed decision whether or not this will be a success in Des Moines. 

We will be looking at the population in Des Moines and comparing it to New York to get an idea how the population difference will affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program.

In order to get a better demographic comparison, gender was also looked at for both cities. Lastly, we were interested where the citibikes were ending up and if Des Moines has similar points of interest. 


### Project Summary
Through our exploratory analysis, we have come to the conclusion that bike-sharing has the potential to be successful in Des Moines under certain circumstances.

Des Moines has a much smaller population compared to New York, meaning that we will not need as many bikes available, and by default will be a lower initial investment. However, when looking at the data,  both cities have a similar male-female percentage and age breakdown, allowing us to assume that there would proportionally be similar percentage of people interested in usig a bike-sharing program. 

 Secondly, from transportation data we can safely assume that bike-sharing will not be used as a way to travel to and from work, as most of the population has access to a vehicle, and the commute time is already low at under 20 minutes, compared to a New Yorkers commute time of 40+ minutes. 

Therefore, we believe that bike-sharing will be most widely used when people are traveling to and from places of interest in the city. 

We suggest that bike-sharing stations are located in areas near places of interest. It is there we expect them to get the most use from local individuals and visiting tourists wanting to get around the city at their own pace.
